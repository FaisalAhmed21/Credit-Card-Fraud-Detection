# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a machine learning project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine using various machine learning models.



## Project Overview
Fraudulent transactions in the credit card industry are a significant concern, and early detection is crucial. This project uses machine learning models to predict fraudulent transactions. The main objective is to develop a high-performing model to minimize false positives and false negatives.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is uploaded in the [Releases](https://github.com/FaisalAhmed21/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection/releases) section of this repository. It contains anonymized credit card transaction data, including features such as transaction amount and derived features from PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

### Dataset Information:
- **Label Encoding:** 
  - `0`: Genuine transaction
  - `1`: Fraudulent transaction


## Installation
